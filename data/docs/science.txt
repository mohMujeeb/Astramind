Water (H2O) is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. It exists in three states: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (vapor). 
The boiling point of water at sea level is 100°C, and its freezing point is 0°C.

Albert Einstein developed the theory of relativity, with the famous equation E=mc^2. This showed the relationship between energy, mass, and the speed of light.
