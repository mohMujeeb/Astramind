The Roman Empire was one of the most powerful civilizations in history, lasting from 27 BCE to 476 CE in the West. 
Its capital was Rome, and later Constantinople in the Eastern Empire. Julius Caesar, Augustus, and Constantine were among its most famous leaders.

The French Revolution began in 1789 and marked a turning point in European history. It led to the end of monarchy in France and the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte.
